## What is a Kidney Tumor?

A kidney tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the kidney that can form a mass. Tumors in the kidney can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The most common type of malignant kidney tumor is renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which starts in the lining of the small tubes in the kidney.
